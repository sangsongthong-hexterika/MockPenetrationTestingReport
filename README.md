# Disclaimer

This repo contains my penetration testing report template and the mock report from TryHackMe, HackTheBox, Virtual Home Lab, etc.

No real client data is being used in this repo.

## Instructions

To use the template, copy what's inside the README.md of the TemplateFolder to use or copy the TemplateFolder so you get both folder structure and the README.md file. The README.md file is the report template that comes with the placeholder images for the front page.
