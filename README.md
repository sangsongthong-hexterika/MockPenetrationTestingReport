## Author's Note

This is just the template so I won't forget the structure. To use this template, just copy this README.md file except this paragraph and use it in the README.md file in your specific report.

I follow TCM Security template, but I made it eaiser to understand for me as a beginner as well as making it a markdown format. I plan to add more information based on TCM Security's template in the future.

At this stage, the report is presented in Markdown format to prioritize clarity and ease of editing while I continue to refine my reporting skills. It will be converted to PDF when required for client delivery or formal presentation.

I will use this template with both mock reports and real data reports. Real clients can reference my the report to this one.

When copying this file, don't forget to delete this section.

## Confidentiality Statement

This document is the exclusive property of [CompanyName] and Hexterika Cyber Lab. This document contains proprietary and confidential information. Duplication, redistribution, or use, in whole or in part, in any form, requires consent of both [CompanyName] and Hexterika Cyber Lab.

## Disclaimer

A penetration test is considered a snapshot in time. The findings and recommendations reflect the information gathered during the assessment and not any changes or modifications made outside of that period.

Time-limited engagements do not allow for a full evaluation of all security controls. Hexterika Cyber Lab prioritized the assessment to identify the weakest security controls an attacker would exploit. Hexterika Cyber Lab recommends conducting similar assessments on an annual basis by internal or third-party assessors to ensure the continued success of the controls.
